# Fomu, I'm

I'm Fomu, an FPGA in your USB port!  I have 128 kilobytes of RAM, and enough logic cells to run a RISC-V CPU and a USB softcore.  I have four contact pads that can easily be used to make two buttons.  And I have an RGB LED, because everyone loves blinky things!

I'm available for [pre-order now on Crowd Supply](https://github.com/crowd-supply-projects/tomu-fpga).
